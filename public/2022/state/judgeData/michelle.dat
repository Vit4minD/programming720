and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure
We are met on a great battle field of that war
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground
The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here
It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under
God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the
earth
